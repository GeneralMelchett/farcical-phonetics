 How can we offer such assurances?
 Because we are unique among UK hosting companies: all our data processing staff are under 12 years of age
 and do not speak any English. We undertake regular audits at all our offices and respond to findings immediately.
 I fact, just last week we discovered that one of our Mauritanian workers was able to understand several English words.
 He was promptly driven into the desert and thrown out of the car.

 Ridicuspell Social Responsibility Statement
 At Ridicuspell we take our social responsibilities very seriously. We are a child-first
 company, and are famous for our taglines: 'Never an Adult When a Child Will Do'. No child leaves undersold. We proudly
 employ 300 children across our sites in Belieze, Myanmar and Mauritania, and without Ridicuspell
 these poor children would have to attend school, reducing the cheap labour available to us in the future.
 We stay fully compliant with all relevant employment and modern slavery laws by engaging our trusted
 partners* to do all the paperwork.
